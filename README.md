# wg-firmware-test

Scripts to automate firmware testing procedures. 

## Getting Started

These scripts should work on any standard Linux system.

### Prerequisites

[expect-lite](http://expect-lite.sourceforge.net) must be installed. The tests otherwise use standard Linux bluetooth and shell utilities.

To install expext-lite on ubuntu (as root):
```
apt install expect-lite
```

### Installing

Clone this repository (or copy) to the Linux system the tests will run on. 

To clone from GitHub via HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/WaterGuru/wg-firmware-test.git
```

Edit the file ```podnames``` if you need to add a pod or ID / alias to existing pod using vi or your default text editor.
